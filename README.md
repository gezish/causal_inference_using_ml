## Overview

> Machine learning algorithms typically prioritize making the most accurate predictions or classifications over providing insights into feature cause-and-effect relationships. However, understanding the cause and effect relationship can be useful in decision-making, particularly in the health sector. It would also aid in the development of more accurate models that exploit not only the data but also the data's cause and effect structure. Causal inference is the process of determining what causes what. Casual inference allows us to answer questions like what causes what and what the effect would be if we improved some features.

> The purpose of this project is to extract useful features by using causal inferences and building the model to predict the diagnosis.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/gezish/causal_inference_using_ml.git
cd causal_inference_using_ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

#### Categorical variables

      * Diagnosis(Malignant / benign)

#### Continuous variables

      * the circumference (mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter)
      * the concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
      * points that are concave (number of concave portions of the contour)
      * fractal dimension of symmetry (“coastline approximation” — 1)
      * the texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
      * Perimeter\s area
      * suppleness (local variation in radius lengths)
      * compactness (area2 / perimeter2 — 1.0)

## Notebooks
